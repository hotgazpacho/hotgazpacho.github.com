# Serverless Kanban

## What? Why?
Serverless Kanban is intended to be a learning project for me. It is a tool for me to learn more about building applications using a [serverless architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html). I come from a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) background, which is an entirely different paradigm ([monolithic architecture](http://microservices.io/patterns/monolithic.html)). I  want to explore building a web application using the serverless approach. Specifically, I want to explore the *managerie* of AWS services, and how to leverage them.

To further my learning goals, I'm setting myself some constraints. First, I'm going to start building using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/). It provides a project structure and set of tools that will allow me to abstract away the complexities of deployment and stay focused on building the thing.
