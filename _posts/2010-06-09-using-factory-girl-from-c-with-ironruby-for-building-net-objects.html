<p>Recently at work, I've been using TDD to drive out the design for some WPF View Models. Part of what I'm doing is filtering a collection based on various properties of the elements in the collection. Of course, I've needed to build up that collection first. I'd come up with a very limited method using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/018hxwa8.aspx" target="_blank">Action&lt;T&gt;</a> to set properties when the builder method was called. While this worked for my needs, I got to thinking about a library I've used a couple of times on Rails projects: <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl" target="_blank">Factory Girl</a>. </p>
<p>On numerous occasions working with C# on .NET, I've thought to myself <q>man, I really wish I had something like Factory Girl here!</q>. So, last night/this morning, I set out to create a <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html" target="_blank">spike solution</a> to determine the feasibility of hosting IronRuby within my C# library, thus allowing me to use Factory Girl to build POCOs for me. The result:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/431058.js?file=gistfile1.cs"></script>
<p>OH YEAH!</p>
<p>Well, at least for the Factory.build method, but that's all I was interested in for this spike.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve put my code up on <a href="http://github.com/hotgazpacho/IronRubyFactoryGirlSpike" target="_blank">github</a> for your perusal. For this particular solution I don't think you'll need Visual Studio 2010, but you will certainly need .NET 4 installed, as well as IronRuby. Also note that IronRuby needs to be installed into C:\IronRuby unless you want to edit the app.config and fix up some references.</p>
<p>I'm excited now about the possibilities of utilizing other Ruby libraries in my .NET projects!</p>
