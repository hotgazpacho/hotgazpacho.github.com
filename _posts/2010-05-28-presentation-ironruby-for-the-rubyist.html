<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb/calendar/13481809/" target="_blank">I gave a talk at the Tampa Ruby Brigade</a> about IronRuby, targeted at the developer who already knows and loves Ruby. About 10 people turned out, including the regional Microsoft Developer Evangelist, <a href="http://www.devfish.net/" target="_blank">Joe Healy</a>&#160;<em>(nice to see Microsoft reaching out to other development communities!)</em>. The crowd was predominantly Mac users, and I had some concerns that the talk might not be well received. Boy, was I worried over nothing! This quote about sums up the reaction:</p>  <blockquote cite="http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb/calendar/13481809/">   <p>I was interested in IronRuby when it was first announced but had lost hope that it would ever be viable. Will did an awesome job of convincing me that it's alive and well. Great talk.</p>    <p>-- Barry Ezell</p> </blockquote>  <p>Nice! Below are the slides, and <a href="http://github.com/hotgazpacho/ironruby-for-rubyists" target="_blank">here are the (admittedly thin) demos up on Github.</a></p>  <div style="width: 425px" id="__ss_4343064"><strong style="margin: 12px 0px 4px; display: block"><a title="IronRuby for the Rubyist" href="http://www.slideshare.net/hotgazpacho/iron-ruby-for-the-rubyist">IronRuby for the Rubyist</a></strong><object id="__sse4343064" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=ironrubyfortherubyist-100528083539-phpapp01&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=iron-ruby-for-the-rubyist" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed name="__sse4343064" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=ironrubyfortherubyist-100528083539-phpapp01&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=iron-ruby-for-the-rubyist" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>    <div style="padding-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 5px">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hotgazpacho">Will Green</a>.</div> </div>
