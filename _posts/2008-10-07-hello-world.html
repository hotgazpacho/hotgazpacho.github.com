Ok, so I'm finally blogging again. Why? A SharePoint contractor at my office today asked me if I had written up a blog post about the SharePoint Master Page I had created to match the branding of <a href="http://www.moffitt.org/">my company's</a>Â web site (which I also deisgned and implemented). So, I intend to use my blog as a platform for showcasing this, and other, works of mine.

So, stay tuned not only for blog posts, but also full-blown articles on web development, web design, and pretty much anything else that interrests me.
