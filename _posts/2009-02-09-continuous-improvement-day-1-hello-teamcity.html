<p><em>Wow, is that post title an oxymoron? What was the tag line on my blog again? ;)</em></p>  <p>Today was the start of my journey on the road of Continuous Improvement. One of the big things I took away from <a href="http://www.actsasconference.com/" target="_blank">acts_as_conference</a> was <em>“Just F***in Do It”</em>. Or, put a little more eloquently by Corey Haines <em>(who I later found out was paraphrasing Ghandi)</em>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Be the trouble you want to see.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, as it turns out, I’ve garnered a certain level of respect with my manager. Basically, my manager provided me with an opportunity to plant the seed of the ideas <em>(which, admittedly, are still germinating in me)</em> that I’ve been able to gave name to recently. Guess what. He was totally receptive! Awesome! I mentioned Continuous Integration, gave him a brief schpeil on the potential benefits, and, perhaps the real selling point, a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" target="_blank">free tool</a>&#160;<em>(recommended by </em><a href="http://www.cornetdesign.com/" target="_blank"><em>Cory Foy</em></a><em>)</em> to do it with. “Great!”</p>  <p>Awesome!</p>  <p>Between helping the new contractor get adjusted, dealing with a <a href="http://twitter.com/hotgazpacho/statuses/1193080368" target="_blank">SharePoint migration issue</a>, and warding off other departments from dumping their vendor issues on my shoulders, I installed Team City on our source control server <em>(did I mention that I hate VSS? Note to self: migrating it to SVN should be in my Continuous Improvement plan).</em> WOW. I mean, WOW! That was dead freaking simple! I struggled with <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET" target="_blank">CruiseControl.NET</a> for what must have been a week, and I had no working build system <em>(recall the part about VSS)</em>. FAIL! I spent a whopping <em>half an hour</em> setting up a build, with system tray monitor AND Visual Studio integration. PASS! However, the build failed, exposing a flaw in the project file. Developer FAIL!</p>  <p>Poet Mattie J.T. Stepanek once wrote:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Every journey begins with but a small step and every day is a chance for a new, small step in the right direction.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Baby steps, folks, baby steps.</p>
