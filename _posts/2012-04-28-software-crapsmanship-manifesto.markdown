title: "Manifesto for Software Crapsmanship"
---
As aspiring Software Crapsmen, we are raising the bar on the rate at which software can be extruded from developers. Through this work, we have come to accept:

Not only **reams of software**,
but also **poorly tested, *if at all*, software**.

Not only **many simultaneous changes**,
but also **breaking changes discovered by the customer**.

Not only **isolation from community**,
but also **specialization within the team**.

Not only the **customer dictating how the product is engineered**,
but also bearing the brunt of **customer dissatisfaction with the result**.

That is, because we fail to adequately communicate how misguided, from our point of view, the items on the left are, we inveitably suffer the demoralizing effects of the items on the right. 

Yet [we march on](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(project_management).
