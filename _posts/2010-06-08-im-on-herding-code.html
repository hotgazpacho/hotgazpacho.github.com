Just a quicky here...

A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://blog.coryfoy.com/">Cory Foy</a> and I <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=254">had a chat with the Herding Code</a> guys. We talked about the differences between developing on the .NET platform and in Ruby/Rails. It was a great time. Please go give it a listen, and do let me know what you think!
