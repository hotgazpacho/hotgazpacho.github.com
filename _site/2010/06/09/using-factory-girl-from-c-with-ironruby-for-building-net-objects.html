    <h1>Using Factory Girl from C# with IronRuby for building .NET objects</h1>

    <p>Recently at work, I’ve been using TDD to drive out the design for some WPF View Models. Part of what I’m doing is filtering a collection based on various properties of the elements in the collection. Of course, I’ve needed to build up that collection first. I’d come up with a very limited method using <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/018hxwa8.aspx' target='_blank'>Action&lt;T&gt;</a> to set properties when the builder method was called. While this worked for my needs, I got to thinking about a library I’ve used a couple of times on Rails projects: <a href='http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl' target='_blank'>Factory Girl</a>. </p>
