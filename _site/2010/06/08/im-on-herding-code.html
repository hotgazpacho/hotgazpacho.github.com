    <h1>I'm on Herding Code!</h1>

    <p>Just a quicky here&#8230;</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href='http://blog.coryfoy.com/'>Cory Foy</a> and I <a href='http://herdingcode.com/?p=254'>had a chat with the Herding Code</a> guys. We talked about the differences between developing on the .NET platform and in Ruby/Rails. It was a great time. Please go give it a listen, and do let me know what you think!</p>
