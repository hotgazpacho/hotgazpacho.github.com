    <h1>Hello world!</h1>

    <p>Ok, so I&#8217;m finally blogging again. Why? A SharePoint contractor at my office today asked me if I had written up a blog post about the SharePoint Master Page I had created to match the branding of <a href='http://www.moffitt.org/'>my company's</a>Â web site (which I also deisgned and implemented). So, I intend to use my blog as a platform for showcasing this, and other, works of mine.</p>

<p>So, stay tuned not only for blog posts, but also full-blown articles on web development, web design, and pretty much anything else that interrests me.</p>
