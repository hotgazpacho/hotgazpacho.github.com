    <h1>New Year, New Mac, New App</h1>

    <p>Well, it&#8217;s a new year and I&#8217;ve got a new machine: a 13&#8221; MacBook Pro, which my amazing wife conspired with my family to get me for Christmas. Since then, I&#8217;ve been playing around with it, trying out apps&#8230; basically kicking the tires to see what I can do with it. I&#8217;ve installed XCode, <a href='http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/'>homebrew</a>, and <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/'>rvm</a>, to name a few. I jumped on the deal to get <a href='http://www.pixelmator.com/'>Pixelmator</a> at half price from the new App Store.</p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s been about 3 weeks, and I&#8217;m settling in to working on the Mac. Gotta say that I really love it; I even find myself trying to use Mac keyboard shortcuts on the PC at work! The Mac is a creation platform, right? and its been a while since I&#8217;ve actually, you know, <em>created</em> something. Time to get down to it!</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a href='http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html'>MEAP</a> copy of <a href='http://www.manning.com/lim/'>MacRuby In Action</a>, which I also picked up during a holiday sale, I&#8217;ve decided to embark on a journey to create my first native Mac app&#8230; in Ruby! Yay! <h3>Introducing PomodoroMRIA</h3> <a href='http://hotgazpacho.github.com/PomodoroMRIA/'>PomodoroMRIA</a>, <a href='https://github.com/hotgazpacho/PomodoroMRIA'>source on GitHub</a>, <em>(so-called because it started as the sample app in chapter 2 of MacRuby In Action)</em> is a simple app for the <a href='http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/'>Pomodoro Technique</a>. Another Pomodoro app? Yes, another Pomodoro app. The domain is relatively small and very easily understood. Yes, there are a number of <a href='http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/'>other</a> <a href='https://github.com/reborg/pomodori'>apps</a>, from which I will undoubtedly draw inspiration. My issues with these other apps include: <ul>
	<li>too many features/options that I don't want</li>
	<li>missing features/options that I do want</li>
	<li>not written by me, so I didn't get to learn MacRuby &amp; Cocoa ;)</li>
</ul> I&#8217;ve got the basic app working, but it is a far cry from what I want it to be. I&#8217;ll be <a href='https://github.com/hotgazpacho/PomodoroMRIA/issues'>tracking bugs and feature requests</a> on github, and judiciously editing them. My goal is to keep the app small and focused; This is my <a href='http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/ch05.html#breakable_toys'>Breakable Toy</a> for learning about developing, testing, and deploying Mac apps. Progress will likely be slow, as I try to keep a reasonable balance in my life, but I&#8217;ll be keeping this space up to date on my progress.</p>

<p>Look for a post on TDD&#8217;ing this app with RSpec next!</p>
