    <h1>Cucumber and IronRuby: It Runs!</h1>

    <p>Ever since I read about <a href='http://cukes.info'>Cucumber</a>, a user acceptance testing tool in Ruby, I’ve wanted to be able to use it, along with <a href='http://ironruby.net/'>IronRuby</a> for my .Net projects. I got it working once, briefly, using the directions on the <a href='http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/ironruby-and-net'>Cucumber wiki at GitHub</a>. With an uncertain combination of IronRuby updates and Cucumber updates, it stopped working for me. Well, this evening, I decided to delve into it once again, and I am now happy to report that <strong>it works!</strong> Well, works, as in <em>runs the C# sample provided with the Cucumber gem</em>. I know present to you the steps I took to get it working, from end to end (I’ll assume you have some version of Visual Studio 2008 with C#):</p>
<p>git clone git://github.com/ironruby/ironruby.git git pull&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p><strong>OR, if you're behind a corporate firewall…</strong></p><blockquote>
  <pre>cd /C/Development
git clone http://github.com/ironruby/ironruby.git
git pull</pre>
</blockquote><h3>3 – Set Up IronRuby Dev Environment</h3><p>This comes straight from the <em><a href='http://wiki.github.com/ironruby/ironruby/devbat'>dev.bat entry in the IronRuby wiki on GitHub</a></em>:</p><blockquote>
  <p>We recommend you start your developing by running<code>C:\path\to\Merlin\Main\Languages\Ruby\Scripts\Dev.bat</code>. This batch file sets up the path, various environment variables, and aliases, which makes it easy to do builds and run tests.</p>

  <p>It is recommended to setup a shortcut to Dev.bat on the desktop that you can just click to quickly get the pre-configured environment. To do this, create a shortcut on the Desktop to cmd.exe (where C:\Development\ironruby is the root of your GIT repo) looking like CmdShortcut.png at <a href='http://www.ironruby.net/Support/Images'>http://www.ironruby.net/Support/Images</a>. The values of the text fields should be like this:</p>

  <p>Target: <code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k &quot;c:\Development\IronRuby\Merlin\Main\Languages\Ruby\Scripts\Dev.bat&quot;</code></p>

  <p>Start in: <code>c:\Development\IronRuby\Merlin\Main\Languages\Ruby</code></p>
</blockquote><p>I highly recommend reading the rest of that wiki entry. It explains how the IronRuby sources are laid out.</p><p>I’m also made a change to Dev.bat. On line 43, after :EnvDone, the script changes the path. I’m going to prepend the path to the IronRuby interpreter, which we’ll compile in the next step. Why prepend? Well, I also have MRI in my path, and I found that the commands in C:\Ruby\bin were getting called instead of the IronRuby versions. <em>This is what I believe was leading to all the difficulties I had in the past.</em> So, the call to SET PATH should look something like this: <code>set PATH=%MERLIN_ROOT%\Bin\debug;%PATH%;%MERLIN_ROOT%\Languages\Ruby\Scripts;%MERLIN_ROOT%\Languages\Ruby\Scripts\bin;%RUBY18_BIN%;%MERLIN_ROOT%\..\External.LCA_RESTRICTED\Languages\IronRuby\mspec\mspec\bin</code></p><h4>Addendum - June 14th, 2009</h4><p>After <a href='http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/ironruby-core/2009-June/004779.html'>some feedback on this post</a> from <a href='http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/'>Jimmy Schementi</a> and <a href='http://blog.jredville.com/'>Jim Deville</a> of the IronRuby team, you’re going to want to set another environment variable, called GEM_BIN. We will reference this variable later, when we go to install gems for IronRuby. After the line that sets GEM_PATH, about line 16, you want to include this additional line: <code>set GEM_BIN=%MERLIN_ROOT%\Languages\Ruby\Scripts\Bin</code></p><p>Adding this will allow us to tell Ruby Gems where to put the scripts needed to run cucumber, or any other gem. I’ve chosen %MERLIN_ROOT%\Languages\Ruby\Scripts\Bin, on Jimmy’s suggestion, because it is already in the path set by Dev.bat, and IronRuby distributes a number of other wrapper scripts, such as igem, irake, and irails in this directory.</p><h3>4 - Compile IronRuby</h3><p>Pop open the IronRuby Development console <em>(the shortcut you created in the previous step)</em>, and run <code>brbd</code> (Build RuBy Debug).</p><h3>5 – Install the Cucumber Gem</h3><p>IronRuby comes with a command called <em>igem</em>, which runs the <em>gem</em> command using IronRuby, as opposed to the standard MRI. In that same development console, run: <code>igem install –-no-rdoc -–no-ri –-bindir %GEM_BIN% cucumber</code></p><p>That’s a lot to type! We could stick all these options into a .gemrc file in our home directory, but this is problematic if you have and use multiple versions of Ruby on your machine <em>(and you most likely will)</em>. Any suggestions for accommodating the scenario of multiple Ruby versions with seperate Gem locations would be very much appreciated! Now, back to the show!</p><p>I’m choosing to include the <code>–-no-rdoc</code> and <code>-–no-ri</code> because RDoc and RI generation is slooooow, and I can’t recall the last time I looked at either.</p><p>I’m also passing the <code>–-bindir</code> argument so that the wrapper scripts for the gems I install will be placed into a directory that is in my path, but will not get overwritten every time I recompile IronRuby.</p><p>This will install the gem files into <code>C:\Development\ironruby\Merlin\External.LCA_RESTRICTED\Languages\Ruby\redist-libs\ironruby\gems\1.8\gems\cucumber-xxxx</code>, where xxxx is the latest version of Cucumber. <em>I'm going to use cucumber-xxxx in the next step to signify the folder that cucumber gets installed into.</em></p><p>This will also install the <code>cucumber &amp; cucumber.bat</code> wrapper scripts into <code><strike>C:\Development\ironruby\Merlin\Main\Bin\debug</strike>C:\Development\ironruby\Merlin\Main\Languages\Ruby\Scripts\Bin</code></p><h3>6 – Verify that it Works</h3><p>Here comes the cool part. In that same IronRuby dev console window, do the following:</p><blockquote>
  <pre>cd C:\Development\ironruby\Merlin\External.LCA_RESTRICTED\Languages\Ruby\redist-libs\ironruby\gems\1.8\gems\cucumber-xxxx\examples\cs
compile.bat
cucumber features</pre>
</blockquote><p>This is the output that I got:</p><blockquote>
  <pre>*** WARNING: You must &quot;gem install win32console&quot; (1.2.0 or higher) to get colour

  In order to avoid silly mistakes
  As a math idiot
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers

  Scenario Outline: Add two numbers                    # features/addition.feature:6
unknown:0: warning: multiple values for a block parameter (2 for 1)
    Given I have entered <input_1> into the calculator # features/step_definitons/calculator_steps.rb:9
unknown:0: warning: multiple values for a block parameter (2 for 1)
    And I have entered <input_2> into the calculator   # features/step_definitons/calculator_steps.rb:9
unknown:0: warning: multiple values for a block parameter (2 for 1)
    When I press add                                   # features/step_definitons/calculator_steps.rb:13
unknown:0: warning: multiple values for a block parameter (2 for 1)
    Then the result should be <output> on the screen   # features/step_definitons/calculator_steps.rb:17

    Examples:
      | input_1 | input_2 | output |
      | 20      | 30      | 50     |
      | 2       | 5       | 7      |

</blockquote><p>Notice that there are still some warnings. I know <a href='http://www.iunknown.com/'>John Lam</a> and the rest of <a href='http://ironruby.net/About/People'>the IronRuby team</a> are working hard for to get this working for the <a href='http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/7965'>1.0 release, due on or about July 23rd, 2009</a>. Most importantly, though, it functions now. Cool beans!</p><h3><strike>SUPER</strike> KIND-OF IMPORTANT NOTE!</h3><p>Any time you rebuild IronRuby, the C# compiler will erase the contents of the directory <code>C:\Development\IronRuby\Merlin\Main\Bin\Debug</code>. This includes the cucumber and cucumber.bat files. <strike>The only way I know to rectify this is to </strike><code><strike>igem install -–no-rdoc -–no-ri cucumber</strike></code><strike> once again.</strike> Thanks to feedback from the IronRuby team, I’ve detailed a fix above. You will only have to install gems once, regardless of how often you recompile IronRuby.</p>
